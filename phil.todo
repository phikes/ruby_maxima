 ☐ hashes need to be handled correctly (just replace any argument that is a hash with a RubyMaxima::Hash, that has its inspect method overriden)
 ☐ there need to be "atomic strings", that are translated into a command without quotation marks (use smth like "abc".atomic) to get a RubyMaxima::AtomicString
 ☐ upload this to RubyGems w/ some docs @later
